- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChristianCloud9
- 👀 I’m interested in software development for multi-platfrom applications. Enriching the user experience when using applications and designing and buidling games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# through free online course, youtube guids and through visual studio, xcode and unity. ASP.NET core through C# docs.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which use C#, which  are good start points for a beginner. Then when feel confident with one lanuage, start learning another lanuage which is similar. 
- 📫 How to reach me through twitter @ChristianJW21 or www.linkedin.com/in/christian-williams-cloud09
